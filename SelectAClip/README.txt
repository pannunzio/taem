ASSIGNMENT 1: User Research to be conducted in person later this week.
To be delivered next Sunday (march 14)

ASSIGNMENT 2: All my databases sorted into 2 Excel spreadsheets - one is my initial collection of words and the other is how I am categorizing my clips.
I kept them in separate workbooks because it made sense. They're also formatted as tables to make searching in excel more user-friendly.

ASSIGNMENT 3: Code (as of Sunday Night)

  * setup.py: Dictionary setup based on the needs and feelings catalog. To Be Run Only Once. Makes a lot of API calls.Â  Very slow but saves time on execution. [COMPLETE]

  * researchAssistant.py: does research on words heard by the AI and categorizes them by needs. Uses initial dictionary and needs/feeling catalog as starting point. [INCOMPLETE BUT WORKS]

  * listenforspeech.py: AKA the brain. Listens for speech when the processing sketch calls for it. Sends results to the RA and to Processing. [INCOMPLETE BUT BASICALLY DONE]

  * The Processing Sketch (in a zip file): what controls the clip selection and most of the AI. It speaks for itself (ba-dum-tss) [INCOMPLETE BUT IT'S GETTING THERE]

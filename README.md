## Thesis Project for RTA New Media courses 82A and B

### Description:
Can a human love a machine? Can there be empathy when communication is limited?
Project explores empathy and conversation through conversing in film clips.
Main tools: Processing and Python

### Code Setup:

#### Software requirements:
  * JVM
  * Python3
  * Processing3
  * For Mac users, xcode coding~~bullshit~~ command lines toolkit

#### Installing python dependencies with pip3 (because I use python3. use regular pip at your own discretion but let me know how that goes)

  ```
    brew install portaudio
    pip3 install python-osc
    pip3 install pyttsx3
    pip3 install SpeechRecognition
    pip3 install PyAudio
  ```
#### Processing Libraries required:
  ```
   processing.video.*
   netP5.*;
   oscP5.*;
 ```
  
**Disclaimer:** Some issues I encounter in this project are mac specific apparently. Let me know if something doesn't happen on other OS's and I'll add multiplatform to a future TO-Do list
